--The following 7 SQL below showcases how I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

--How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?

SELECT COUNT (distinct orderID) AS distinct_orders
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT (distinct orderID) AS distinct_orders
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND product = 'iPhone';

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT DISTINCT cust.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT DISTINCT product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC 
LIMIT 1;

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT product, SUM (quantity) * price AS total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT product, SUM (quantity) AS total_quantity, SUM (quantity) * price AS total_price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP by product;

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT
count(distinct cust.acctnum) AS total_customers,
avg(quantity*price) AS avg_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
