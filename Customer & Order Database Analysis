--The following SQL below showcases how I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

--How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?

SELECT COUNT (distinct orderID) AS distinct_orders
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT (distinct orderID) AS distinct_orders
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND product = 'iPhone';

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT DISTINCT cust.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT DISTINCT product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC 
LIMIT 1;

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT product, SUM (quantity) * price AS total_revenue

WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT

--Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
--In other words, show the one product that generated the most revenue (revenue being equivalent to quantity of an item multiplied by the item’s price).
